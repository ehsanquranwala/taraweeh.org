	  <tr><td><p>Idol worshippers, mushriks think that by just saying a spell the mountain will move, earth will open up and water will spring up even if no one knows what's the meaning of the spell. Unfortunately we Muslims take this Quran no more than some spell to solve our matters. Some of us just take it out in Ramadhan but the emphasis is on completing its recitation as many time as possible.</p>
	      <p>Just imagine that you are feeling cold, if you start saying &quot;blanket&quot; &quot;blanket&quot; you will not stop feeling the cold even if you say &quot;blanket&quot; one lac times, on the other hand if you take a blanket over you, then you may save yourself from cold.<br />
	        OR<br />
	        Just think that you are feeling thirsty, if you keep saying &quot;water&quot; &quot;water&quot; from morning to evening, your thirst will not go, it will rather increase but if you drink some water you will feel relieved.</p>
	      <p>Similarly if you keep reciting quran without understanding, you may get the sawab for every letter you recite (according to a hadees) but the real purpose of Quran which is guidance (Hidayah) cannot be achieved. You will have to understand it to get the Divine guidance in it to succeed in this world and hereafter.</p></td></tr></table>
