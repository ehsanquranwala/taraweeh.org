So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that  month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the  prescribed period (Should be made up) by days later. Allah intends every  facility for you; He does not want to put to difficulties. (He wants you) to  complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and  perchance ye shall be grateful.<br />

And whosoever of you is present, let him fast  the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, (let him fast the  same) number of other days. Allah desireth for you ease; He desireth not  hardship for you; and (He desireth) that ye should complete the period, and  that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that peradventure ye  may be thankful. <br />
            <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> The month of Ramazan is that in which the Quran was  revealed, a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the  distinction; therefore whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast  therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like)  number of other days; Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire for  you difficulty, and (He desires) that you should complete the number and that  you should exalt the greatness of Allah for His having guided you and that you  may give thanks.</p>

Say: He is only One Allah. Lo! I am innocent of that which ye  associate (with Him). <br />
            <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> Say: What thing is the weightiest in testimony? Say:  Allah is witness between you and me; and this Quran has been revealed to me  that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches. Do you really bear  witness that there are other gods with Allah? Say: I do not bear witness. Say:  He is only one Allah, and surely I am clear of that which you set up (with  Him).</p>

            <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> This Qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than  Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before  it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the  Lord of the worlds. <br />
            <strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be  invented in despite of Allah; but it is a confirmation of that which was before  it and an exposition of that which is decreed for mankind - Therein is no doubt  - from the Lord of the Worlds. <br />
            <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those  besides Allah, but it is a verification of that which is before it and a clear  explanation of the book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord of the worlds.</p>

            <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or  the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be  the one!) But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things! Do not the  Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind  (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them  for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of  Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise. <br />
            <strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause  the mountains to move, or the earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak,  (this Qur'an would have done so). Nay, but Allah's is the whole command. Do not  those who believe know that, had Allah willed, He could have guided all  mankind? As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to strike them  because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of  Allah come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst. <br />
            <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> And even if there were a Quran with which the  mountains were made to pass away, or the earth were travelled over with it, or  the dead were made to speak thereby; nay! the commandment is wholly Allah's,  Have not yet those who believe known that if Allah please He would certainly  guide all the people? And (as for) those who disbelieve, there will not cease  to afflict them because of what they do a repelling calamity, or it will alight  close by their abodes, until the promise of Allah comes about; surely Allah  will not fail in (His) promise.</p>
