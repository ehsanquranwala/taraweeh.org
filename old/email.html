      Do you know that Quran is the speech of Allah?<br />
      If yes, Have you ever tried to understand what Allah says in it?<br />
      Or atleast do you know the meanings of what you recite in your prayers daily?<br />
      Do you believe that Quran is a book of guidance?<br />
      If yes, do you try to seek guidance from it?<br />
    How far have you gone in worldly eduction and how much of the Quran have you read with meanings?<br />
These are the questions which majority of us cannot answer but what should we do? Remain as we are!!!</td>

      2 Taravih (in which the divine words are recited to us) to empower our soul, our spiritual being.<br  />
      * Dora Tarjuma Quran is the best form of the 2nd program in which we also get to know what is being recited in Taravih.<br  />
    We invite you to avail this unique opportunity at any place</a> near you and spread this information in your contacts.<br  /><br  />
	There are separate arrangements for ladies at most of these places.<br  />Besides Taravih there are special Dora Tarjuma Quran Programs for ladies in day time also.<br  />
