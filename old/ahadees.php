  </th></tr>
  <tr><td align="justify"><span class="style25"><strong>The Holy Prophet  said</strong></span><br />
        <p class="style25">1)  The best of you are the ones who learn the Qur&rsquo;an and teach it to others [Al-Bukhari]</p>
	      <p class="style25">2) Undoubtedly, the heart gets rusted like metal gets rusted when water goes over it. The People asked, &quot;How can they [hearts] be cleaned.&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;To remember death in abundance and to recite the Holy Quran.&quot; (Mishkat)</p>
	      <p class="style25">3) That chest which does not have any Quran in it is like an abandoned house. (Tirmizi, Darmi)</p>
	      <p class="style25">4) Whoever read the Quran and memorized it and believed its Halal to be Halal and its Haram to be Haram [i.e., accepted it commandments of Halal and Haraam], Allah will accept the intercession for such 10 people on from him whom Hell had already become Wajib. (Tirmizi, Ibn-e-Majah)</p>
	      <p class="style25">5)Verily the one who recites the Qur&rsquo;an beautifully, smoothly, and precisely, he will be in the company of the noble and obedient angels (Kiraman Katebeen). And as for the one who recites with difficulty, stammering or stumbling through its verses, then he will have TWICE that reward.&rdquo; [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
	      <p class="style25">6)It will be said to the companion of the Qur&rsquo;an: Read and elevate (through the levels of the Paradise) and recite with Tarteel (clear and distinct recitation) as you used to do when you were in the dunyaa! For verily, your position in the Paradise will be at the last verse you recite. [Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee, saheeh]</p>
	      <p class="style25">7) Allah says, &quot;Whoever was kept busy with the [recitation] of Quran from my Zikr and asking me, I will give him better than those who I give to those who ask&quot; and the excellence of the Word of Allah over all the other words is like the excellence of Allah over all his creation.</p>
	      <p class="style25">8) Learn the Quran and read it because whoever learned the Quran and read it and did Qayam with it is like a bag filled with Musk whose fragrance is spread everywhere and whoever learned the Quran and slept that is he did not do Qiyamul Layl is like a bag which is filled with Musk and its mouth has been closed. (Tirmizi, Ibn-e-Majah, Nisaee)</p>
	      <p class="style25">9) Read the Quran when you heart feels affection and attachment and when your heart becomes bored stand up that is stop reciting the Quran. (Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
	      <p class="style25">10) Decorate the Quran with your (good) voices. (Mishkat)</p>
        <p class="style25">11) O People of the Quran, do not make the Quran a pillow, that is do not be lazy and be careless, and read the Quran in the day and night like it is the Haq of Recitation, and spread it, that is, read with good voices or do not take compensation for it, and whatever is in it, reflect upon itso that you may attain success, and do not hurry in its reward because the reward for it is great (which will be given in the Akhirah). (Bahiqi)</p>
        <p class="style25">12) Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward. And that reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that &ldquo;Alif, Laam, Meem&rdquo; is a letter, rather I am saying that &ldquo;Alif&rdquo; is a letter, &ldquo;laam&rdquo; is a letter and &ldquo;meem&rdquo; is a letter.[At-Tirmithee]</p>
        <p class="style25">13) The Qur&rsquo;an is an intercessor, something given permission to intercede, and it is rightfully believed in. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise; whoever puts it behind him, it will steer him to the Hellfire. [At-Tabaraanee]</p>
        <p class="style25">14) Read the Qur&rsquo;an, for verily it will come on the Day of Standing as an intercessor for its companions. [Muslim]
        <p class="style25">15) In Saheeh Muslim, we find a lovely story, about how a man from the people of Jannah, &lsquo;Umar ibn Al-Khattaab, understood this principle. Some men came to question him during his khilaafah about the leadership of Makkah, they asked, &ldquo;Who do you use to govern Makkah?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Ibn Abzaa.&rdquo; They asked, &ldquo;And who is Ibn Abzaa?&rdquo; Umar replied, &ldquo;A freed slave from those we freed.&rdquo; They remarked, &ldquo;You left a freed slave in charge of the people of the Valley (the noble tribes of the Quraysh)!?!?&rdquo; So he answered them, &ldquo;Verily he is a reader of the Book of Allah and is knowledgeable about the obligations of the Muslims. Haven&rsquo;t you heard the statement of your Messenger: &ldquo;Verily Allah raises some people by this Book and lowers others by it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="style25">16) Indeed the Prophet (sallallaahu &lsquo;alaihi wa sallam) summarised this Religion with his statement: &ldquo;The Religion is naseehah (sincerity)!&rdquo; So then Tameem ibn Aws, may Allah be pleased with him, then said, &ldquo;We asked, &lsquo;To whom?&rsquo;&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;To Allah, HIS BOOK, His Messenger, the leaders of the people, and their common folk.&rdquo; [Muslim]<br>
          <em>The sincerity that is due to the Book of Allah includes its regular recitation, learning the rules of tajweed and reciting it beautifully, learning about its tafseer and the reasons for its revelation, affirming that it is the Truth, the perfect Speech of Allah and not part of the creation, honoring it and defending it, abiding by the orders and prohibitions found in it, teaching it and calling to it. [See Jaami&rsquo;ul-&rsquo;Uloom wal-Hikam of Ibn Rajab Al-Hambalee]</em> </p>
        <p class="style25">17) And the Qur&rsquo;an is a proof for you or against you. [Muslim] <br />
            <em>So one of two things will occur with this proof, the Book of Allah. It will either be in your favor, a proof for you on the Day when you will need every single good deed, or it will be something standing against you, the very Speech of your Creator, a proof against you! Who could be saved from the terrors of that Day if Allah&rsquo;s own Speech is against him?!?! Think carefully, dear Muslim brother or sister, about your position with the Qur&rsquo;an! Are you neglecting it, contradicting it, being heedless of its orders and prohibitions, are you thinking deeply over it?! Will it be on your side on the Day of Judgment.?! O Allah! We ask you, by Your Glorious Speech and the rest of your beautiful Names and Attributes, to make the Qur&rsquo;an a proof for us! O Allah! Don&rsquo;t make the Qur&rsquo;an a proof against us on that Day, and save us from the hellfire! For if Allah makes the Qur&rsquo;an a proof in our favour on that Day, then it would also be an intercessor for us, when NO intercession will take place except by His Permission.</em> </p>
        <p class="style25">Rewards for certain Surahs and Ayahs</p>
        <p class="style25">The Holy Prophet  said:</p>
        <p class="style25">1) Surah Fatiha is a cure from every illness. (Darmi, Bahiqi)</p>
        <p class="style25">2) Do not make your home a graveyard, the Shaitan runs from the home in which Surah Baqarah is recited. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
        <p class="style25">3) Whoever memorized the first ten ayahs of Surah Kahf will be saved the Dajjal. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
        <p class="style25">4) Whoever recites Surah Kahf on the day of Jummah, there will be a Nur brightened for him between two Jummahs.</p>
        <p class="style25">5) Everything has a heart and the heart of the Quran is Surah Yaseen, whoever read Yaseen, Allah will write the reward of reading the Quran ten times from him. (Tirmizi and Darmi)</p>
        <p class="style25">6) Whoever reads Surah Yaseen for the pleasure of Allah, his past sins will be forgiven so read this near your deceased. (Bahiqi)</p>
        <p class="style25">7) (Reading) Qul hu WAllahu Ahad (Surah Ikhlas) is equal to [reading] one third of the Quran.</p>
        <p class="style25">8) Whoever read Ayatul Kursi after every Fard Salah, he will be under the protection and security of Allah. (Darmi)</p>
        <p class="style25">9) (On the Day of Judgement) a caller will say O Recitor of Surah Inaam, come to Jannat for loving Surah Inaam and its recitation.</p>
        <p class="style25">10) Surah Tabarak (Surah Mulk) saves one from Hell.</p>
        <p class="style25">11) Whatever task is not begun with Bismillahi Rahamni Raheen remains incomplete and unfinished.</p>
        <p class="style25">Dear brother or sister, these benefits are a few from the many benefits available and they can only be attained by a sincere commitment to the Book of Allah, not by a person&rsquo;s mere statement, &ldquo;I love the Qur&rsquo;an, it&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo; Rather the heart must be sincerely attached to Allah&rsquo;s Book and the limbs and tongue will follow in this attachment. You must know that we only mentioned a few of the numerous benefits of reading and reflecting over the Qur&rsquo;an. There are many benefits that await your reading in the Qur&rsquo;an and books of hadith, like the chapter of the Qur&rsquo;an that will argue on your behalf in the grave, and that it is a physical healing, a source of rest and relaxation for your heart, among many other things. And Allah knows best.</p></td></tr>
