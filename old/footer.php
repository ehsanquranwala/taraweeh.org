<marquee truespeed="truespeed" onmouseover="this.stop()" onmouseout="this.start()" ><span class="style22">O thou folded in garments! [73:1]Rise to pray in the night except a little[73:2]: Half of it, or lessen it a little[73:3] Or a little more; and recite the Qur'an in slow, measured rhythmic tones. [73:4]-----------

Do they not Ponder over Quran or their hearts are locked?[47:24]-----------

And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? [54:17, 54:22, 54:32, 54:40]-----------

Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn listened (to the Qur'an), and they said: Lo! we have heard a marvellous Qur'an[72:1]-----------

We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal to thee this (portion of the) Qur'an...[12:3]-----------

Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong)...[2:185]-----------

Had We sent down this Quran on a mountain, you would certainly have seen it falling down, splitting asunder because of the fear of Allah, and We set forth these parables to men that they may reflect.[59:21]-----------

My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels[23:66]-----------

Say: "The (Qur'an) was sent down by Him who knows the mystery (that is) in the heavens and the earth: verily He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."[25:6]-----------

And the Messenger cried out: O my Lord! surely my people have treated this Quran as a forsaken thing.[25:30]-----------

And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation (thereof). [25:33]-----------

Ta Sin! These are the verses of the Quran and the Book that makes (things) clear[27:1]-----------

Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this (Qur'an), nor am I a pretender.[38:86]-----------

Nay, but their hearts are in overwhelming (confused) ignorance of this (Qur'an), and they have other works, besides, which 
they are doing;[23:63]---------

Also, they say: "Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities?" [43:31]--------
---

Behold, We turned towards thee a company of Jinns (quietly) listening to the Qur'an: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, "Listen in silence!" When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people, to warn (them of their sins). [46:29]They said, "O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path. [46:30]-----------

Nay! it is a glorious Quran[85:21] (Inscribed) in a Tablet Preserved![85:22]----------- 

Behold this(Quran) is the Word that distinguishes (Good from Evil)[86:13] It is not a thing for amusement.[86:14] -----------

If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things!...[13:31]-----------

Surely this Quran guides to that which is most upright and gives good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a great reward.[17:9]-----------

Establish worship at the going down of the sun until the dark of night, and (the recital of) the Qur'an at dawn. Lo! (the recital of) the Qur'an at dawn is ever witnessed.[17:78]-----------

We send down (stage by stage) in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe...[17:82]-----------

Say: "If the whole of mankind and Jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof...[17:88]

And We have explained to man, in this Qur'an, every kind of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude![17:89]-----------

And (it is) a Qur'an that We have divided, that thou mayst recite it unto mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by (successive) revelation.[17:106]-----------

So have We made the (Qur'an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention.[19:97]-----------

High above all is Allah, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with the Qur'an before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, "O my Lord! advance me in knowledge."[20:114]-----------

A Book, whereof the verses are explained in detail;- a Qur'an in Arabic, for people who understand.[41:3]Giving good news and admonition: yet most of them turn away, and so they hear not.[41:4]-----------

The Unbelievers say: "Listen not to this Qur'an, but talk at random in the midst of its (reading), that ye may gain the upper hand!" [41:26]-----------

...Say: "It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their (eyes): They are (as it were) being called from a place far distant!" [41:44]-----------

Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur'an: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her, and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden, and some in the Blazing Fire.[42:7]-----------

...We have made the (Qur'an) a Light, wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will...[42:52]-----------

We have made it a Qur'an in Arabic, that ye may be able to understand (and learn wisdom).[43:3] And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book, in Our Presence, high (in dignity), full of wisdom.[43:4]-----------

Hold fast to the rope of Allah (Quran) and be not divided among yourselves.
