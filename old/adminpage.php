<a href="newprogram.php">Add a New Program</a><br  />
New program means, a new program to be entered on this website, it may have taken place any time the past. Before adding a new program you should check it in the existing programs, to avoid duplicate entries. When you add a program it becomes visible on the page linked from the Places link on the main page if it is of the current year while older programs can be seen from the history.  When entering the program you will need to select a place where the program will be held and speaker(s), huffaz and management from the already entered data. So its better to make all the relevent entries before entering a program but its not necessary because you can also leave them blank and update them later. Rest of the details can be added on the new program page itself. <br  />
<a href="selectprogram.php">Select an Existing Program to Edit</a><br  />
Existing program means a program already entered on this website, it may not have taken place as yet.<br  />
<a href="newplace.php">Add a New Place</a><br  />
Places where Dora Tarjuma Quran is being held for the first time should be entered here, but this entry will be of no use unless a program is added with this place selected in it.
Before adding a new place you should check it in the existing places, to avoid duplicate entries.<br  />
<a href="selectplace.php">Select an Existing Place to Edit</a><br  />
<a href="selectcurrentplace.php">Select an Existing Place of Current Year to Edit</a><br  />
Existing place means a place already entered on this website.<br  />
<a href="newuser.php">Add a New User</a><br  />
Although new user registration is done from the create account on the main page but administrators can also create accounts for users here.This is useful when certain users don't have internet access but their accounts need to be created because they are one of the speakers, huffaz or in management of any Dora Tarjuma Quran program. <br  />
<a href="allusers.php">Select a User's Profile to Edit</a><br  />
Speakers, Huffaz or people in management all create an account from the create account link on the main page but a flag needs to be set for every user declaring that he is one of the speakers, huffaz or in management and that can be done only by the adminstrators of this website by editing their profile. The speakers, huffaz or in management who are shown in the list when adding or editing a program depend on the flag and their names are shown only if the respected flags are set in their accounts. <br  />
